## Grain Synthesizer for 'Rikitu' Epizoon
g2 is a grain synthesizer developed for an interactive artwork. It reads audio samples from a folder and creates various audio grains in multiple layers, the behaviour of which can be controlled by environmental values that get sent via Serial port. Grains and compositions can be stored in JSON-Files or new compositions can be created in a graphic interface via mouse/keyboard and a midi controller (for now, only APC Key 25 is supported).
